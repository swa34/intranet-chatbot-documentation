# Email Version for Testers

## Subject: Intranet Chatbot Testing - We Need Your Department's Input

Dear [Department Lead],

We're launching our new AI-powered intranet assistant and need your help to train it on department-specific questions. We're currently in the initial testing and training phase, and your feedback will directly improve how the chatbot serves your department. We're asking for one experienced staff member from your department to test the system by asking 10-15 typical department questions (takes about 20 minutes total). If you have a new employee (< 6 months), having them participate would provide valuable perspective on onboarding questions.

Here's what testers need to do: Visit https://hospitalitychatbot-r7f2j.sevalla.app/, ask questions naturally as they would to a colleague, and after each response click 👍 or 👎 and add a brief comment explaining what was helpful or what was wrong (broken links, outdated info, missing steps). Focus on three types of questions: basic department info (contacts, locations), common processes (forms, approvals, procedures), and frequent issues your team faces. The key is providing specific feedback - instead of just "wrong," explain what the correct answer should be. We may ask for a brief follow-up test in 4-6 weeks (just 3-5 questions) to validate improvements, but after that the system will learn continuously from regular use.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Ultra-Short Version (if needed)

We need 1 person from your department to spend 20 minutes testing our new intranet chatbot at https://hospitalitychatbot-r7f2j.sevalla.app/. Have them ask 10-15 department-specific questions and click thumbs up/down after each answer with a brief comment about what was helpful or incorrect. If you have a new employee, their perspective would be valuable too. This initial training phase feedback will help the AI better serve your department's needs.
