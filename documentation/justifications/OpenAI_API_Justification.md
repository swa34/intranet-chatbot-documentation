- Locating forms and resources across multiple intranet sites
- Reducing time spent searching for information from 15+ minutes to under 30 seconds
- Supporting 24/7 availability for remote and field staff

- Text embeddings: ~$0.02 per 1M tokens
- Average cost per query: ~$0.002
- Expected queries/month: 25,000-50,000

## Business Value
