# File System Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Completed Successfully!

### Before Cleanup
- **Root directory**: Cluttered with 20+ files
- Test files mixed with source code
- Documentation scattered throughout
- Batch scripts in root
- Data files mixed with code

### After Cleanup
- **Root directory**: Only 5 essential files
  - `README.md` - Main documentation
  - `INGESTED_CONTENT.md` - Tracking document
  - `package.json` & `package-lock.json` - Node dependencies
  - `.env` files - Environment configuration

### New Organization

#### Created Directories:
1. **`tests/`** - All test files moved here
   - test-abo.js
   - test-crawl.js
   - testExtractUrl.js
   - test_date_priority.js
   - test-response.html

2. **`scripts/`** - Batch scripts organized
   - process_all_georgia_counts.bat
   - process_dropbox_api.bat
   - process_intranet_dropbox.bat

3. **`data/`** - Static data files
   - RESOURCE_LINKS.json
   - Georgia_Counts_Dropbox_Links.txt
   - sitemap files

4. **`documentation/`** - Project documentation
   - `/setup/` - Setup guides
   - `/guides/` - User guides
   - CLEANUP_PLAN.md

5. **`feedback/`** - Preserved user feedback data

6. **`config/`** - Configuration files
   - Google Sheets credentials

### Key Benefits
✅ Clear separation between chatbot app (`src/`) and ingestion app (`python/`)
✅ Test files isolated in dedicated directory
✅ Documentation organized and easy to find
✅ Scripts and data files properly categorized
✅ Root directory clean and professional
✅ Better developer experience for new contributors

### Note on uga-intranet-Bot
- This appears to be an older/duplicate version of the project
- Feedback data has been preserved in `./feedback/`
- Can be safely removed after user verification

### Next Steps
1. Verify all functionality still works
2. Consider removing `uga-intranet-Bot/` directory after confirmation
3. Update any documentation that references old file paths
4. Commit the new clean structure to git
