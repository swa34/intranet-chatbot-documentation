# Intranet Chatbot Testing Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the testing phase for our new AI-powered intranet chatbot. We're conducting a department-wide testing phase to ensure the chatbot provides accurate, helpful responses for all departments. Your feedback is crucial for improving the system's performance and training it to better understand department-specific needs.

## Project Status

We're currently in the initial testing and training phase. Your feedback now will help train the system to better understand department-specific needs. We may request additional testing in 4-6 weeks to validate improvements, but that round will be much shorter (3-5 questions). After that, the system will learn continuously from regular usage.

## Testing Objectives

1. Evaluate the chatbot's ability to answer department-specific questions
2. Identify knowledge gaps or inaccuracies in responses
3. Gather feedback on answer quality and usefulness
4. Build a training dataset to improve future responses

## Who Should Test

- **Primary Tester**: 1 experienced staff member from each department who knows department processes well
- **Secondary Tester** (if available): 1 new staff member (< 6 months) who can provide fresh perspective on onboarding questions

## Testing Requirements

### Number of Questions

**Target: 10-15 questions per department**

- Minimum: 10 questions to provide meaningful data
- Maximum: 15 questions to avoid tester fatigue
- Mix of simple and complex queries

### Question Types to Include

#### 1. Basic Information (3-4 questions)

- Department contact information
- Office locations and hours
- Key personnel and roles
- Department services overview

#### 2. Process & Procedures (4-5 questions)

- How to submit requests/forms
- Approval workflows
- Department-specific policies
- Standard operating procedures

#### 3. Common Issues (3-4 questions)

- Troubleshooting department systems
- Frequently asked questions
- Common problems and solutions
- Emergency procedures

#### 4. New Staff Questions (2-3 questions) - _If testing with new employee_

- Onboarding procedures
- Training resources
- Who to contact for help
- Department tools and systems

## How to Test

### Step 1: Access the Chatbot

1. Navigate to: https://hospitalitychatbot-r7f2j.sevalla.app/
2. Log in with your network credentials (authentication may be removed for testing)
3. You'll see the chat interface ready for questions

### Step 2: Ask Your Questions

1. Type questions naturally, as you would ask a colleague
2. Be specific about your department when relevant
3. Try variations of similar questions to test understanding
4. Note any follow-up questions the chatbot suggests

### Step 3: Provide Feedback

**After EACH response:**

1. Click 👍 (Helpful) or 👎 (Not Helpful)
2. **IMPORTANT**: Add comments explaining your rating:
   - For 👍: What made it helpful? Was anything missing?
   - For 👎: What was wrong? What would be correct?
   - Mention any broken links, outdated info, or partial answers

### Step 4: Document Issues

Keep a simple log of:

- Questions that received poor/incorrect answers
- Missing information the chatbot should know
- Suggestions for improvement

## Feedback Examples

### Good Feedback Examples

- "Helpful, but the link to the form is broken - should be /forms/leave-request"
- "Answer was correct but missing step 3 - need manager approval first"
- "Not helpful - this is the old process, new system launched in January"

### Poor Feedback Examples

- "Wrong" (doesn't explain what's incorrect)
- "Bad answer" (doesn't provide correct information)
- "Didn't help" (doesn't explain what was needed)

## Testing Timeline

- **Daily Testing Time**: 15-20 minutes
- **Duration**: Approximately 2-3 weeks per phase
- **Feedback Review**: As needed throughout testing

## New Staff Perspective

If you have a new team member (< 6 months), please have them test separately with focus on:

### Onboarding Questions

- "How do I request time off?"
- "How do I set up my benefits?"
- "What training is required for my role?"
- "Who are the key contacts in [department]?"

### System Access

- "How do I get access to [department system]?"
- "Where can I find tutorials for [specific tool]?"

## Why Your Feedback Matters

Your feedback directly improves the chatbot through:

1. **Source Ranking**: Frequently helpful sources get prioritized
2. **Issue Detection**: We identify and fix broken links/outdated info
3. **Knowledge Gaps**: We add missing information based on failed queries
4. **Pattern Learning**: The system learns which sources work for specific question types

## Data Privacy

- All feedback is anonymous in the learning system
- Questions and responses are used only for improvement
- No personal information is shared outside the development team

## Support & Contact Information

If you encounter technical issues or have questions about testing:

- **Technical Issues**: Contact IT Help Desk
- **Testing Questions**: Contact the Project Lead
- **Urgent Issues**: Submit through standard IT support channels

**Subject:** Intranet Chatbot Testing - We Need Your Department's Input

Dear Team,

We're launching our new AI-powered intranet assistant and need your help to train it on department-specific questions. We're currently in the initial testing and training phase, and your feedback will directly improve how the chatbot serves your department.

**What we need:**
- One experienced staff member from your department to test the system by asking 10-15 typical department questions (takes about 20 minutes total)
- If you have a new employee (< 6 months), their participation would provide valuable perspective on onboarding questions

**What testers need to do:**
1. Visit https://hospitalitychatbot-r7f2j.sevalla.app/
2. Ask questions naturally as they would to a colleague
3. After each response, click 👍 or 👎 and add a brief comment explaining what was helpful or what was wrong (broken links, outdated info, missing steps)

**Focus on three types of questions:**
- Basic department info (contacts, locations)
- Common processes (forms, approvals, procedures)
- Frequent issues your team faces

**Key point:** Provide specific feedback. Instead of just "wrong," explain what the correct answer should be.

**Follow-up:** We may ask for a brief follow-up test in 4-6 weeks (just 3-5 questions) to validate improvements, but after that the system will learn continuously from regular use.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
