## Risk Mitigation

### Conservative Timeline Rationale
- **Extra buffer time** between phases for unexpected issues
- **Learning curve** for feedback system optimization
- **Content updates** may require manual intervention
- **Department availability** for testing coordination
- **Integration issues** with existing systems
- **Change management** needs time for adoption

### Contingency Plans
- **If Phase 2 fails:** Extend internal testing by 2 weeks
- **If Phase 3 has low participation:** Extend by 1 week with follow-ups
- **If Phase 4 reveals major issues:** Add 2-week remediation phase
- **If Beta shows problems:** Can extend beta by 2-4 weeks
